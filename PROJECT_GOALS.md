# HUB System V1.0 - Project Goals

## Main Objective
Test communication and uploading to multiple environments for the HUB System Combined Board V1.0

## Core Goals

### 1. Communication Testing
- Establish reliable communication between Master and Slot boards
- Test Serial communication protocols
- Verify I2C bus functionality
- Implement and test USB MUX switching

### 2. Multi-Environment Upload Testing
- Successfully upload firmware to Master board (COM13)
- Successfully upload firmware to all 5 Slot boards (COM14-COM18)
- Test simultaneous operations across multiple boards
- Verify board isolation and independence

### 3. Hardware Verification
- Test IO Expander functionality for slot control
- Verify power control for individual slots
- Test boot mode selection
- Validate USB routing through MUX

## Development Approach
Starting from scratch with clean, well-structured code:
- Incremental testing approach
- Clear separation between Master and Slot functionality
- Proper error handling and recovery
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Success Criteria
- All boards can be programmed independently
- Master can communicate with all slots
- No hardware conflicts or damage
- Stable and repeatable test results

## Next Steps
1. Implement basic serial echo test for each board
2. Add Master-Slot communication protocol
3. Implement power and boot control
4. Add USB MUX switching capability
5. Create comprehensive test suite
